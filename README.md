Ever wanted to make those fancy embeds that pops up when you send a link on Discord? Well, today is your lucky day ‚Äî you found the perfect template for it!
## Installation
### Step 1
To get started, you can either fork this repository or copy and paste what is written in [template.html](https://github.com/KnightTheFluff/discord-link-embed/blob/main/template.html) to your code editor of choice.
### Step 2
Edit whatever you want in the empty spaces provided in the template to display the content you would like to show. Refer to the image below for guidance with meta tags and the title tag.<br>
**NOTE: The empty spaces in the template is to improve readability. Please do not actually include the spaces in your final product.**<br>

### Step 3
Once you are satisfied with the changes you've made, pick a hosting service to host the HTML online.<br>
Below is a list of free-forever hosting services you can rely on to do the said task:<br>
| Hosting Service  | Installation Guide                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cloudflare Pages | [View](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/guide/) |
| GitHub Pages     | [View](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)                |
| Netlify          | [View](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/)                      |

I personally recommend you to use **Cloudflare Pages** as it has the most flexibility for development.
### Step 4
Think you got everything set up via your selected hosting service? Great! Paste the link you made with your chosen host on Discord and watch the magic happen.<br><br>
*P.S. The embed may or may not work on other social platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram or even ùïè (Twitter). I haven't tested to see if it will work or not so fingers crossed.*
