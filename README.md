# Discord Link Embed Template
### A free template for creating link embeds for Discord.
To get started, you can either fork this repository or copy what is written in [template.html](https://github.com/KnightTheFluff/discord-link-embed/blob/main/README.md).
Once you've done that, you can edit whatever you want in the empty spaces provided in the template to display the content you would like to show.
